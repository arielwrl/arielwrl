### Projects

#### [starlight_toolkit](https://github.com/arielwrl/starlight_toolkit) 
A toolbox to organize output data from the Starlight spectral synthesis code (Cid Fernandes et al., 2005; Werle et al. 2019).

#### [pysinopsis](https://github.com/arielwrl/pysinopsis)
This is a similar toolbox made for pre-processing and analysing the hyperspectral imaging data of the [GASP project](https://web.oapd.inaf.it/gasp/).

#### [arielwrl.github.io](https://github.com/arielwrl/arielwrl.github.io) 
Personal website including a blog, built with eleventy, pico CSS, and love.

#### [river_mapper](https://github.com/arielwrl/river_mapper) (in development) 
I have always been curious to know where rivers go, and this curiosity has grown since I moved to Rotterdam. This project uses data from [HydroRIVERS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrorivers) to map a river network from a starting point. Results for Rotterdam are currently incomplete due to the limitations of HydroRIVERS in river delta regions, but the code gives good results in less complex regions.

#### [local_llm](https://github.com/arielwrl/local_llm)
This is a painfully experimental project that uses WebLLM to run a chatbot locally with WebGPU. It is a nice proof of concept, but requires very good hardware to work properly.

#### [BAGPIPES-activity](https://github.com/arielwrl/BAGPIPES-activity)
Lessons in Bayesian inference of galaxy properties using BAGPIPES.
